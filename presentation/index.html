                    JWT is. Next, we will consider its structure and formation rules. Let's analyze what a heder, swill,
                    signature is. After that, we will analyze how the token is verified. In conclusion, I will present
                    ways to further explore the topic. So, take comfortable seat and I'll begin.

                    JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way
                    for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

                        JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained
                        way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can
                        be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with
                        the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        For better undestanding of JWT, let's imagine a realworld situation. For example, we want to
                        register on a web-site. In our case, there are will be three participants — user, application
                        server and authentication server. The authentication server will provide to user a token, whitch
                        help to interact with the application.
                        First of all, user sign-in providing the credentials (for example, username and password, using
                        Facebook, Google, or same service if possible). The authentication server then creates a JWT and
                        sends it to the user.
                        When the user makes API calls to the application, the user passes the JWT along with the API
                        call. It must be included in header of every request.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The application server must be configured to verify inbound JWTs and check if they are generated
                        by the authentication server. So, when a user makes API calls with a JWT attached, the
                        application can use the JWT to verify that the API call comes from an authenticated user.

                        So, let's take a closer look at the process of creating and verifying a JWT token.

                        The JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature. Let's go through each of
                        them.
                        The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing
                        algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
                        For example:
                        ...slide...
                        Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.

                        Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is
                        encrypted.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements
                        about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. For example, the authentication
                        server creates a JWT with the user information stored inside of it, specifically the user ID.

                        ... slide info ...

                        In this example, we are only putting one claim into the payload. You can put as many claims as
                        you need, but keep in mind that the size of the data will affect the overall size of the JWT.
                        This generally isn’t an issue but having large JWT may negatively affect performance and cause
                        latency.

                        Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted

                        The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of
                        tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says
                        it is.
                        Creating signature using the following pseudo code:

                        ... slide info ...

                        The result with our example data may looks like this:

                        ... slide info ...

                        The base64url algorithm encodes the header and payload created in steps 1 and 2. The algorithm
                        concatenates encoded strings through a dot. Then, the resulting string is hashed by the
                        algorithm specified in the header based on secret key.

                        If you want to play with JWT and put these concepts into practice, you can use [jwt.io
                        Debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) to decode, verify, and generate JWTs.

                    Now that we know how to encode a JWT, decoding is pretty easy. We start by splitting the token
                    by the periods, and then decode each section separately:

                    ... slide info ...

                    The slightly more complicated part is when we need to verify the signature. We do this by
                    recreating the signature from the header and payload using our secret, and then check to see if it
                    matches the signature we were given. If it doesn't, then either the token isn't authentic or it has
                    been altered in some way.

                    ... slide info ...

                    Keep in mind that in most cases you should check the header to see which algorithm was used in
                    the signature. I can skip that part here for our purposes.

                        establish a trust relationship between a user and an application. But this is just a piece of
                        the puzzle of the big topic of authorizing and securing web applications. We have covered only
                        the basics, but without them it is impossible to move on.
