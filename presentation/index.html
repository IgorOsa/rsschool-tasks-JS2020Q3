                        what JWT is. Next, we will consider its structure and creation rules. Let's see what a header,
                        payload, and signature are. After that, we will look at how the token is verified. In
                        conclusion, I'll suggest links to further explore the topic.

                    JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way
                    for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

                            can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a
                            secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.</p>

                        <p>For better undestanding of JWT, let's imagine a realworld situation. For example, we want to
                            register on a web-site. In our case, there are will be three participants — user,
                            application server and authentication server. The authentication server will provide to user
                            a token, whitch help to interact with the application.
                        </p>
                        <p>First of all, user sign-in providing the credentials (for example, username and password,
                            using Facebook, Google, or same service if possible). The authentication server then creates
                            a JWT and sends it to the user. When the user makes API calls to the application, the user
                            passes the JWT along with the API call. It must be included in
                            header of every request.</p>

                        <p>The application server must be configured to verify inbound JWTs and check if they are
                            generated by the authentication server. So, when a user makes API calls with a JWT attached,
                            the application can use the JWT to verify that the API call comes from an authenticated
                            user.</p>

                        <p>The JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature. Let's go through each of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the
                            signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <p>... slide info ...</p>
                        <p>Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.</p>

                        Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is
                        encrypted.
                    </p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements
                            about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. For example, the authentication
                            server creates a JWT with the user information stored inside of it, specifically the user
                            ID.</p>

                        <p>... slide info ...</p>

                        <p>In this example, we are only putting one claim into the payload. You can put as many claims
                            as you need, but keep in mind that the size of the data will affect the overall size of the
                            JWT. This generally isn’t an issue but having excessively large JWT may negatively affect
                            performance and cause latency.</p>

                        <p>The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of
                            tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it
                            says
                            it is.</p>

                        <p>The result with our example data may looks like this:</p>

                        <p>... see the slide ...</p>

                        <p>The base64url algorithm encodes the header and payload created in previous steps. The
                            algorithm concatenates encoded strings through a dot. Then, the resulting string is hashed
                            by the algorithm specified in the header based on secret key.</p>

                        <p>If you want to play with JWT and put these concepts into practice, you can use <a

                        <p>The slightly more complicated part is when we need to verify the signature. We do this by
                            recreating the signature from the header and payload using our secret, and then check to see
                            if it matches the signature we were given. If it doesn't, then either the token isn't
                            authentic or it has been altered in some way.</p>

                        <p>Keep in mind that in most cases you should check the header to see which algorithm was used
